2. Import the environment file (optional)

## üîê Private vs Public Collections

### Public Link
- Anyone with the link can import
- Good for open sharing
- Can be viewed without Postman account

### Private Link (Team Workspace)
- Only workspace members can access
- Better for sensitive APIs
- Requires Postman account and invitation

**Recommendation**: Use Team Workspace for internal APIs, public link for documentation/testing purposes.
